6) Change the installation path in the /etc/bashrc file inthe OpenFoam-v1906 directory.
	a. By default, the project directory will be at $HOME/OpenFOAM.

		1. comment this statement  
                   projectDir="$HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-$WM_PROJECT_VERSION"

		2. uncomment this statement 
		   projectDir="/usr/local/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-$WM_PROJECT_VERSION"

		3. Include the above statement if it is not present.
   
7) Source the installation by typing of19 or by typing source /usr/local/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v1906/etc/bashrc

        a. Notice that the directory has been changed to OpenFOAM-v1906

9) Compile openFoam
	a. Type the following
		1. ./Allwmake -j -s -l 2>&1 | tee log_compile.txt
		2. This will compile and redirect the stdout and stderr to the file log_compile.txt using all the cores of the system.

12) Create User run directory
	a. mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN

	b. type run in the terminal so that the directory is changed to ~/OpenFOAM/<user>-v1906/run
   

13) Test installation with a simple tutorial.
